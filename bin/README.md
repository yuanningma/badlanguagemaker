## Project Ideas
### Idea: Research Literacy 
#### Problem: 
Research papers are dense and challenging to read. This project aims on giving reader access to necessary background information and simplifying the current paper text and data.  
#### Requirements/ Critical Features: 
* Topic Summary
  * Reason for Inclusion: Provides a summary of a specific topic based on papers in database. 
  * Challenging Aspect: Implementing an algorithm that will accurately summarize the topic.
* Linking necessary information
  * Reason for Inclusion: Allows readers to get more information if they wish.
  * Challenging Aspect: Automatically generating relevant links and offering them to the reader.
* Abstracts for each link
  * Reason for Inclusion: Doesn’t force the reader to click on the link to get an idea of what it’s about.
  * Challenging Aspect: Producing an abstract of the link.
* Commentary Section
  * Reason for Inclusion: Gives user the ability to see the text explained in a simpler way. In other words, users can make comments that would explain concepts in similar terms.
  * Challenging Aspect: Crowdsourcing and being able to identify whether or not the comment is helpful or not.

### Idea: Optimizing Patient Records / Files in a digital format (Healthcare)
#### Problem: 
There is a lag time between patient data being collected and records being updated, as well as an issue with relevant data being easily accessed by healthcare professionals. This project aims to have a centralized and easily readable platform for healthcare professionals to update and access patient information. 
#### Requirements/ Critical Features: 
* Inputting and updating data
  * Reason for Inclusion: The main premise of the project where users are able to store and update data into a secure location.
  * Challenging Aspect:  Coming up with a intuitive design that is better than the design currently out there (ie. eClinicalWorks).
* Data visualization (especially making charts clear)
  * Reason for Inclusion: Healthcare professionals need to access patient data, but also be able to understand and reference it.
  * Challenging Aspect: Using JS and HTML to provide a clean user interface.
* Timeline of information / relevant dates
  * Reason for Inclusion: It is relevant to healthcare provider’s to see a patient’s history.
  * Challenging Aspect: Connecting the timeline to other aspects of the patient’s data / profile.
* Possibly sharing / transfer of information between doctors
  * Reason for Inclusion: Patients change providers often, but their provider’s need access to their records for adequate care.
  * Challenging Aspect: Transfer of information securely is difficult.
* Security of info (HIPPA)
  * Reason for Inclusion: Privacy of patient information is legally required by all software handling patient information.
  * Challenging Aspect: Learning HIPPA Laws and implementing data security measures considering none of us have studied data security.
* Storage of insurance / billing / id info
  * Reason for Inclusion: Insurance / billing / id information is essential to the current US healthcare system.
  * Challenging Aspect: Incorporating pdf / image storage into our software / memory use.
